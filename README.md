# P22-Mouse-Click
Module 13 Project 2 (Mouse click)

Requirements
Create a web page that contains a topic that interests you. If you don't want to reveal anything about yourself, fake the topic. Make your page interactive by writing a function that responds to a click anywhere on the page. When the user clicks the page, display an alert dialog that contains either:

the event name if the user held Shift during the mouse click or
the element name that triggered the event if the user held Ctrl during the mouse click.
