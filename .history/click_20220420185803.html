                <p>
                    Tent camping is a great pastime in Florida. The wonderful weather meets the
                    fantastic flora and fauna resulting in an beautiful adventure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Florida is home to all sorts of camping experiences. From beaches, natural
                    springs, national forests, to the Everglades. There are so many different parks
                    and biomes it is near impossible to run out of potential adventures!

                    Perhaps you want to experience nature in Florida, but you cannot dedicate the
                    time or money for a full camping trip. A day hike is a great way to get away
                    from the hustle and bustle without breaking the bank or draining your vacation
                    days.

                <p>
                    Much like with camping, Florida is home to numerous hiking trails of varying
                    lengths and difficulties. Lots of great sights to see and a great way to get
                    some exercise and sunshine.

                    <h2>Overnight Hiking</h2>
                    <p>
                        Overnight hiking is great if you're looking to go off the beaten path and
                        experience nature in Florida and you want to go for more than a couple of
                        hours. Essentially, you are combing both camping and hiking. Backpacking and
                        through-hiking are two other terms commonly used.

                        Be sure to check out the National Parks and Wildlife Service's website for
                        rules and regulations. Pay careful attention to rules and guidance about
                        fires and cutting from living trees and plants. It is also advisable to let
                        park staff know you are planning on hiking overnight know your destination
                        and how long you intend to take.
